# JNI UDP Live Image Streaming Library
This library is a fork of the UDP Live Image Streaming library by chenxiaoqino. The main() functions in Server.cpp and Client.cpp were combined into one library called Library.cpp, and a JNI wrapper is wrapped around it for use in Java code. This fork is mainly prepared for Abington Friends School's Roobotics Robotics Team's entry into the 2017 FIRST Robotics Competition.
